# Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript

Welcome to my repository for the **"JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures"** course by ***freeCodeCamp***! ðŸš€
This repository hosts five projects completed during the course, showcasing various algorithms and data structure implementations using JavaScript. 

## Projects Included

1. **Palindrome Checker**: A utility to check whether a given string is a palindrome.
2. **Roman Numeral Converter**: Converts numbers into their equivalent Roman numeral representation.
3. **Caesar's Cipher**: Implements the famous Caesar's cipher encryption and decryption.
4. **Telephone Number Validator**: Validates if a given string follows a specific telephone number pattern using regex.
5. **Cash Register**: A program that calculates the change to be given using the least amount of currency.

## Key Features

- **FreeCodeCamp Certification**: Included certification image to showcase completion of the course.
- **Project Screenshots**: Screenshots of each project for a visual overview.
- **JavaScript Implementation**: All projects are coded in JavaScript, demonstrating algorithmic understanding.
